Python, Rust, C++, Swift, Go, C#, TypeScript, SQL

**Frameworks & Libraries:**  
Docker, Node.js, React, OpenCV, TensorFlow, SwiftUI, Fyne, Scikit-learn

**Cloud & Infrastructure:**  
Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AWS, BigQuery, Firebase, Compute Engine, Cloud Functions

**Databases:**  
PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase Realtime Database

**Core Interests:**  
Machine Learning, Blockchain & Web3, Applied Cryptography, Privacy-Centered Systems, Distributed Architecture

### Current Work
**Founder & Lead Developer — TrustDrop (in development)**  
A cross-platform, peer-to-peer file transfer application built in Rust and Tauri with full end-to-end encryption and zero cloud dependency. TrustDrop is designed to deliver secure, private file transfers between devices — targeting industries where data integrity and compliance matter.

- Engineered with Rust for safety, speed, and reliability  
- Uses Tauri for lightweight, cross-platform desktop delivery  
- Local-first architecture with cryptographic verification and no third-party storage  
- Built for high-security environments including healthcare and legal industries  
- Preparing for commercialization with planned enterprise features

### About
I approach engineering with a product mindset, balancing low-level systems knowledge with user-centric design. I'm building for privacy, performance, and scale, and always looking to push the boundaries of what secure systems can do in the real world.
